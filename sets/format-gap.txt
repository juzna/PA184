These data sets for the GAP have been taken from the data sets
available at the OR Library:

http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/gapinfo.html

The format for each of these data files is:

- number of different problem sets
- for each problem set in turn:
  number of workers (m), number of tasks (n)
- for each worker j (j=1,...,m) in turn:
  cost of allocating task i to worker j
- for each worker j (j=1,...,m) in turn:
  resource consumed (tij) in allocating task i to worker j
- resource capacity (Tj) of agent j (j=1,...,m)
